# ModellingNeurons_NetPyNE
Modelling Neurons and Networks course project work using NetPyNE

parameters_setup.py is the core of the NetPyNE handling. All parameters regarding cells, populations, synapses, stimulations, simulation, etc. are defined in this file.

test.ipynb is a jupyter notebook I used for running the simulation based on the defined parameters and generating plots, checking the data, and creating the GID lists for partial stimulations.


Please note that these files contain the final state of the project, but I have left in many commented lines that I have used for various testing purposes. These files, therefore cannot be simply run to recreate all views and results for the project at once. They can be considered as work-in-progress project files in a continuing experiment, rather than a complete result. Thank you for your understanding.
